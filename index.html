    <h1>SWEN-101</h1>
    <h2>About Me:</h2>
    <p>
        I came to RIT from Wayne Central, where I played varsity soccer as a forward
        and track & field as a sprinter and jumper. I'm quite active and like to ski,
        waterski, snowmobile, mountain bike, and camp. My main passion outside of programming
        lies in creative writing. Stemming from that, I have an interest in all things fantasy,
        castles, and mythology. But otherwise, I'm drawn to programming because of the creativity,
        versatility, and problem-solving involved.
