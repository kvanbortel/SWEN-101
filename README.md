# SWEN-101

About me:
I came to RIT from Wayne Central, where I played varsity soccer as a forward and track & field as a sprinter and jumper. I'm quite active and like to ski, waterski, snowmobile, mountain bike, and camp. My main passion outside of programming lies in creative writing. Stemming from that, I have an interest in all things fantasy, castles, and mythology. But otherwise, I'm drawn to programming because of the creativity, versatility, and problem-solving involved.

My favotite food is BBQ ribs:
